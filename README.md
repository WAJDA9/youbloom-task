A new Flutter project.

# Running the App

After cloning the repository, you have two options to run the app: building an APK and installing it on a device, or running it directly on a device or emulator.

## Option 1: Build APK and Install

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.

2. Build the APK:
   ```
   flutter build apk
   ```

3. Once the build is complete, install the APK on your connected device:
   ```
   flutter install
   ```

## Option 2: Run on Device/Emulator

1. Ensure you have a device connected or an emulator running.

2. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.

3. Run the app:
   ```
   flutter run
   ```

This will build and run the app on your connected device or emulator.

## Usage

- You can type in any phone number and verification code at login as it's just mock verification.
- once you're at home feel free to test the app.

## Troubleshooting

- Make sure you have Flutter installed and properly set up.
- Ensure your device is connected and recognized by running `flutter devices`.
- If you encounter any issues, try running `flutter doctor` to diagnose and resolve common problems.
